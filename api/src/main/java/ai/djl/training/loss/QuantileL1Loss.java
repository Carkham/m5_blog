/**
 * {@code QuantileL1Loss} calculates the Weighted Quantile Loss between labels and predictions. It
 * is useful in regression problems to target the best-fit line at a particular quantile. E.g.,
 * to target the P90, instantiate {@code new QuantileL1Loss("P90", 0.90)}. Basically, what this loss
 * function does is to focus on a certain percentile of the data. E.g. q=0.5 is the original default
 * case of regression, meaning the best-fit line lies in the center. When q=0.9, the best-fit line
 * will lie above the center. By differentiating the loss function, the optimal solution will yield
 * the result that, for some special cases like those where \partial forecast / \partial w are
 * uniform, exactly 0.9 of total data points will lie below the best-fit line.
